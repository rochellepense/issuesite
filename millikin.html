<p>Millikin University is considered to be a safe space for many minority groups. However, despite this, there are several groups that feel some injustice towards them. One example of this is the LGBTQ+ community on campus. While Millikin University expresses its support for diversity, there are some issues that the students are facing. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Discrimination based on people's own point of view</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>A lot of students till believe themselves to be the only ones who are right. They are not very open-minded and tend to discount anyone whose opinion is different from theirs.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Homophobia</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>I feel like a lot of the people on the sports floor in Dolson are insanely homophobic. I live on that floor and I have heard so many not okay things said. It worries me that if they knew I was gay, what would they say or do? It makes me feel on edge</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Searching for drama</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>Instead of just observing things happening and fixing them, a lot of people seem to be purposefully looking for something to be upset over</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Inclusivity, specifically in the bookstore </h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>I have not experienced anything bad during my brief time at Millikin. However, I havenâ€™t seen much promotion for the LGBTQIA + group. As well as other minority groups, not just the LGBTQIA+ community. When I started at Millikin I went to the bookstore for a few shirts. One I was looking for in particular was a Pride Millikin shirt. I was shocked and disappointed to find out there were none. All there were were your basic Millikin shirts. But on one wall, every sport was represented. That made it even more disappointing. They would make sure all the sports have shirts available for them and family, but minority groups did not. I know other colleges have shirts representing those groups. This is something I actually want to change and tackle. I want to bring those items to the groups that Millikin may not see as important.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Slurs used against people</h3>
<p>Some of the fraternities were caught using slurs last year and it really put me off joining Greek Life.</p>
